# SubFrames

`SubFrames` represents a collection of subsets of a DataFrame.
It has an Array of indices `#subset_indices` which is able to create an Array of sub DataFrames.
The concept includes `group` operation of a Dataframe, rolling window operation and has more broad capabilities.

This feature is experimental. It may be removed or be changed in the future.
